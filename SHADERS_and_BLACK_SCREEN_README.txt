If you have shader issues, like black screens, run hard_disable_shaders.bat (on Windows) or hard_disable_shaders.sh (on Linux).
Alternatively, rename shaders.xml in the /content folder to something else (like shaders.xml.disabled).
This will need to be redone after the mod updates;
(but no worries, since updates aren't that frequent).
