This folder contains alternate code files for things that
now use Repentogon and didn't before.
Did it htis way to avoid adding a lot of REPENTOGON checks
inside the features' code, and just replace them at load,
to simplify the development of this.

Note: when possible, library stuff uses REPENTOGON inside
the file instead, as keeping the old and new version of the
file in sync in case new stuff is added that is used by other
fiels would be a pain. Current exception is color.lua as with
Repentogon it was entirely redone.

When Rev requires Repentogon (Ch. 3), this folder and associated
functionality will be removed.
