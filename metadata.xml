This is the Repentance version of the mod, for the Afterbith+ version [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1536643474]see here[/url].

This mod [i][b]REQUIRES[/b][/i] the [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1348031964]StageAPI[/url][/b] mod to function, and the [b][url=https://repentogon.com/]REPENTOGON[/url][/b] mod is [b]heavily recommended[/b] for performance, features and to avoid download failures, and will be required in Chapter 3.

[b]IF YOU HAVE STRANGE ERRORS AFTER INSTALLING THE MOD, TRY DELETING THE MOD'S FOLDER AND RESTARTING THE GAME (see below)[/b]

[i]Abandon all hope ye who enter here.[/i]

The first two chapters of [i]Revelations[/i] bring two new dangerous floors to start your journey through the circles: beware of the freezing cold, the wandering draugr, and the conveniently placed hockey pucks of the icy [b]Glacier[/b], and try to survive the many deadly traps and the persistent resurrecting enemies of the heretical [b]Tomb[/b].

[img]https://i.imgur.com/kwfx5Y5.png[/img]

[list]
    [*] 2 new floors, with many original and unique mechanics.
    [*] [b]Glacier[/b], an alternative floor to Basement and Downpour, with a freezing cold, a few warm places, heaps of snow, and frosty winds that move you around.
    [*] [b]Tomb[/b], an alternative floor to Caves and Mines, with tons of traps to spice up your path.
    [*] The Hub: a improved transition room to choose between modded alternative paths, also spawning in the first room in case you want to skip ahead to the modded content. 
    [*] [b]Sarah[/b]: a fallen angel trying to gain back her wings, keeping her evil at bay.
    [*] [b]Dante and Charon[/b]: a traveler and his guide, trying to find their way through the circles.
    [*] 17 new bosses and minibosses, like the friendly narwhal Prong, the manic demon Maxwell, the merrily dancing Ragtime.
    [*] 80+ enemies, which you'll meet in the new floors, and a few in the vanilla path.
    [*] 61 new items. Burn it down with Burning Bush, grow an army with Cabbage Patch.
    [*] Shrines: optional challenges in each Revelations floor that give you Vanity, that you can spend at the end of the chapter for extra rewards at Prank's shop. With plenty of surprises waiting to be discovered!
    [*] Reworked sin battles for each Revelations stage, each with their own music variation
    [*] Unlocks: progress in the mod to unlock more items.
    [*] Options: [b]press C[/b] to open a config menu, shared by other mods too, and also containing our achievements.
    [*] Infinite fun
    [*] Mirrors?
[/list]

[i]Reflect[/i] on your misdeeds.

The Vanity Update marks the launch of the mod for Repentance, bringing with it much needed polish to many parts of the mod, some new enemies and bosses, and the rework to shrines that named the update.

As above, the mod requires [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1348031964]StageAPI[/url][/b].

[h2]Recommended mods[/h2]

The Chapter 3 character, [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2297456697]Bertran[/url][/b], got released as a standalone mod by DeadInfinity and Melon!

As of the Vanity update the [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1978904635]MiniMAPI[/url][/b] mod by WofSauge and Taz is [b]included[/b] with Revelations, allowing for custom map icons and behavior (for example, the new Dante + Charon functionality) by default. It can be configured via the C settings or with Mod Config Menu if it is installed. The version included in Revelations can work alongside the standalone version linked above, and it is in fact recommended to install both so MinimapAPI can receive updates more frequently without having to rely on the Rev update cycle.

Revelations is intended to be compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2851063440]Fiend Folio[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2881008017]Retribution[/url], and they are recommended for an amazing gameplay experience. Do mind that Revelations and Fiend Folio are very large mods, which might cause performance issues in lower end machines, and some engine issues, see Mod Compatibility below.

[h3]Incompatibilities[/h3]

The mod is incompatible with:

[list]
    [*] Music Mod Callback
    [*] Minimap mods
    [*] Good Trip (MinimapAPI has an option for similar functionality)
    [*] Enhanced Boss Bars
[/list]

Details in [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2880387531/3488628040296710233/]related discussion[/url].
Some will make rev floors not work, others may have only minor issues but running them is not supported.

TO AVOID ISSUES, RESTART ISAAC AFTER DOWNLOADING AND ENABLING THE MOD FOR THE FIRST TIME.

[h2]Download Failures[/h2]

See [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2880387531/6208841617673899678/]this thread[/url] for information on handling download failures. Note that using Repentogon as recommended should largely avoid this sort of issue.
